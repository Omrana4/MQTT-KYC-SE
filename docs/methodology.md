  2. Ensure real-time data processing and visualization.
- **Research Questions**:
  1. How does MQTT QoS 1 impact the reliability of KYC data transmission?
  2. What are the performance trade-offs of SQLite vs. in-memory storage for real-time analytics?
- **Approach**: Agile methodology with sprints (April 5â€“13), daily scrums (see logbook.md).
