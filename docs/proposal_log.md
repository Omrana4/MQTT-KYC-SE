- **Initial Ideas (April 5)**: Smart Home Monitoring System, MQTT Chat App, KYC Verification System.
- **Discussion**: Smart Home too complex, Chat App too simple. KYC chosen for balance of complexity and feasibility.
- **Alternative Proposals**: Adjusted KYC to include region-based analysis after Omranâ€™s suggestion.
